* Introduction

A personal project \\
An editor

In rust

I might not believe in God, but i might need their help
-----

Inspired by
- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]], which I believe to be the best editor yet with its fully modal nature
- [[https://www.vim.org/][Vim]] and [[https://neovim.io/][Neovim]], with what I believe to be the best way of movement in text with its separation of text edition actions into modes

* Goals

- Keyboard first, if using mouse makes something easier, the project is a failure
- Fast, native, async(?)
- Modality first, currently activated modes determine what happens
- Everything as a command call, ability to modify what should happen when
- Terminal ([[https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui][ratatui]]) and standalone ([[https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit][winit]] + [[https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano][vulkano]]) app support
